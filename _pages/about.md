I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the University of South Florida. I love making visualization and graphs out of data very much (and yes, data munging too). 

On the side, I work as a computer technician at the Hillsborough Community College. Usually my job requires me to troubleshoot and diagnose PCs and teacher's stations, but I also tutor students with programming, math, and statistics assignments. I actually enjoy the latter part the most. 

I am looking for internship opportunities that require anything to do with data, and I am particularly interested in working in marketing, journalism, or technology fields.
