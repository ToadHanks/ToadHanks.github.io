I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the University of South Florida. I adore all things data and randomness life throws at me very much!
     
On the side, I am working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant. Most of my tasks involve writing code-scripts, then presenting the data visually and qualitatively to my team. Furthermore, I also assist students in programming, math and statistics courses at the Hillsborough Community College. I like to learn, collaborate and teamwork, therefore, I thoroughly enjoy my daily activities.
       
In my free time, I enjoy movies made by The Wachowskis sisters, music produced by Deep Forest and love to play nothing but Age of Empires videogames.    
     
I am looking for an exciting internship/job opportunity in the data science & analytics field. Lastly, I will leave [my traits](https://opendatasurgeon.github.io/), which are on my home page, to your interpretations.

Thank you & have a nice day!
