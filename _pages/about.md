I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the University of South Florida. I adore all things data and fractals very much {of course, I also enjoy the boring data munging part too because it gives me an excuse to not move}.

On the side, I work as a Computer Technician at the Hillsborough Community College. Usually, my job requires me to troubleshoot and diagnose PCs, but I also tutor students in programming, math and statistics courses. I actually enjoy the latter part the most. 

I am looking for an exciting internship/job opportunities in the data science field. I will leave my traits, which are on my home page, to your interpretations.

Thank you & have a nice day!
