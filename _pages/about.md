Hello!

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the University of South Florida. I love anything and everything related to data. I adore graphs and data visualization very much (of course data munging too).

On the side, I work as a Computer Technician at the Hillsborough Community College. Usually my job requires me to troubleshoot and diagnose PCs, but I also tutor students in programming, math, and statistics classes. I actually enjoy the latter part the most. 

I am looking for exciting internship/job opportunities in the data science field. 

Thank you & have a nice day!
