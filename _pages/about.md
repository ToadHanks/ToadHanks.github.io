Designed in India. Made in the USA. Thank you for stopping by.

I'm Mihir Patel, a recent grad from Tampa, currently working as a [tutor](https://www.hccfl.edu/support-services/academic-success-centers) and a [research assistant](https://lonihagen.wordpress.com/) at the Hillsborough Community College and the University of South Florida, respectively. 

Been fortunate enough to gain and share knowledge in the academic space for six-plus years, but the time has come to see what is happening outside of academia.

Proficient in R, Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, C++, however, can quickly learn new stuff.

I enjoy reading what goes around the world (esp. in regions of East Asia, South Asia and the South East Asia) in free-time. 

Always ready for collabrating. Learning. Growing. 

Cherish all the randomness in life.
