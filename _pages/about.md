I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the University of South Florida. I adore all things data and randomness life throws at me very much!

Currently I am doing a Summer Research Internship at the University of South Florida under [Dr. Loni Hagen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eVzJHmkAAAAJ&hl=en). However, on the side, I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant. Most of my tasks involve writing code-scripts, then presenting the data visually and qualitatively to my team. Furthermore, I also assist students in programming, math and statistics courses at the Hillsborough Community College. I like to learn, collaborate and teamwork, therefore, I thoroughly enjoy my daily activities.
       
In my free time, I read what goes around the world (esp. in regions of East Asia, South Asia, South East Asia, and Middle East). I also like to play chess and Age of Empires.       
     
I would welcome any internship/job opportunity in the data science & analytics field. Finally, I will leave [my traits](https://opendatasurgeon.github.io/), which are on my home page, to your interpretations.

Thank you & have a nice day!
