I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the University of South Florida. I adore all things data and fractals very much.

On the side, I am working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant. Most of my tasks involve writing code-scripts and present the data visually. Furthermore, I also assist students in programming, math and statistics courses at the Hillsborough Community College. I like learning, collaboration and teamwork, therefore, I thoroughly enjoy both of my work.

I am looking for an exciting internship/job opportunity in the data science & analytics field. Lastly, I will leave my traits, which are on my home page, to your interpretations.

Thank you & have a nice day!
