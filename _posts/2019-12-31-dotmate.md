This program reads from a text file, which contains most searched queries of Menstruation topic, and uses user input to find the necessary information. User can interact with the program by typing statements. The primary audience of this program is ill-informed individuals who want to explore more about female menstruation. However, please note that everyone and anyone is open to use it as they please.Then there is a Calendar tool, which user can users get their next period. It allows prompts as well, and will guideyou accordingly.

This program is purposefuly designed to not have any selection menu. So, every interaction between you and the program should be genuine. The program interaction is very simple. For instance, if you want to say *"what is a Period?"* Or say, *"can a womans period change?!"* Then you would type that, entirely, no special format is needed. You may make a spelling error, or accidenently hit number,and misplace a punctuation. Or, you may put many spaces. Fret not, this program can handle these types of user errors. However, please not that excesssive spelling erros does lead to bad answers. It is advised to double check what you want to ask. Your input matters.

Where your input is needed in an exact manner, the program would tell you. Or it would react in an obvious way which you weren't expecting. In these casses, unfortunately, you can only do, what's being asked from you.

Moreover, if you would like to see next period day, say *"Hey! I want to calculate my next period?"* Or, you can say *"I am planning a vacation with my wife so....?"* When you type these type of phrases, the program will prompt you for information and in the end it will make you a calendar which you can modify, print and plan your family vacation/ resort trip according to what your relative and you see fit.

When you're done & want close the program, you can simply close it,or can type, *"Exit the program! Bye!"* And the program will close.

Please feel free to look through the **source code** [here](https://github.com/ToadHanks/dotMate).

When program start, you're greeted with a welcome screen (by the way, that color bar slowly fills up too, it's pretty neat) like this here-

Then programs asks your name. Goal for this was to collect who is visiting the app, and then if that user visits the app back, we will say *Welcome again!*. This makes user more connected to the app-

And here is what console show when a user returns-

To start the program, you can ask question related to menstruation. There is a list of questions in the Navigation section if you scroll all the way down, [here](https://github.com/ToadHanks/dotMate), which you can ask. This program was to experiment a question-answer pedia in an offline environment. Anyways, when a question you ask is found, the texts which get returned are marked in a green like shown here-
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/dotmate/green_questions.png" alt="">

If lets say you either mistyped a question or looking queries based on a general term, program will list all of the closely matched question like shown below. Here I have searched the general term "Period"-

Here is a quesiton which represent a question which is very mistyped, I guess accidentally-

Then in this, when mistakes are not so extreme-

Basically the trick for something like above was to use a method known as "Fuzzy String Algorithm." There are many string matching algorithm online, but the one I am most familiar is called the *Levenshtein Distance*. In a nutshell, every time you ask a question/input in the console, the algorithm I had put in would make edits to it, and would match the resulted edit with bunch of data feed I have made in the supplemental file. Then it would return an output in a form of a response. Pretty neat, eh?

Moving on, there is also a built in tool in the program which can predict the next Period if you provide necessary info. I can't tell you how much work I have put in this alone. I had to make an account in various woman dominated forums to ask how they calculate their period, ask my mother how she keeps tracks of her menstrual cycle. I even asked my female friends, boss, and teachers about the calculating the menstural cycle. Anyways, here is an example of that with one of the many ways to get to that tool-

The tool also notfies the user and advises if an abnormal menstrual duration is entered. You can see that in red in the picture above.

Lastly, the program will give the user the next expected date for the period, and asks if he/she would like to have that recorded in a calendar. Here are examples of those-

Here is the calendar with marked X on the next date. And a random quote from the list of 7-10 quotes in the bottom row. 
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/dotmate/calendar.png" alt="">

Really quick story about the quotes-> They are all said by my mom over the years :)

This is it. It was an attempt to make something valuable from me, and of course more can be done to this program. So, please, if you think something can be added, feel free to enhance the program; I will greatly appreciate your effort. I have included all of the documentations, and put a lot of effort on commenting the code so you won't be lost at any point.
