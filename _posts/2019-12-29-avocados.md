In this project I am forecasting the price of Hass Avocados in 2019-2020 using the time-series, and ARIMA. I have used the CSV file containing average price and average volume of avocados, and regions where these avocados are sold.

Please feel free to look through the source code and data file [here](https://github.com/ToadHanks/storyOfHassAvocadoIn2020).

I love avocados however when I go out to eat, the rising price of guac leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So I looked around what kind of data set is around. Luckily, there was one data set lying around that had records from 2015 till early 2018. So I asked myself, *"Should I buy an Avocado Orchard the way Oprah did?"* So I used the timeseries and ARIMA model to forecast the prices of Avocados and their volume through 2020.

I started out by comparing the month to month pricing of both conventional and organic avocados:

That's intresting, because conventional started out expensive last year,
