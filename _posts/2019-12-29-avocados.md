In this project I am forecasting the price of Hass Avocados in 2019-2020 using the time-series, and ARIMA. I have used the CSV file containing average price and average volume of avocados, and regions where these avocados are sold.

Please feel free to look through the **source code** [here](https://github.com/ToadHanks/storyOfHassAvocadoIn2020).

I love avocados however when I go out to eat, the rising price of guac leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So I looked around what kind of data set is around. Luckily, there was one data set lying around that had records from 2015 till early 2018. So I asked myself, *"Should I buy an Avocado Orchard the way Oprah did?"* So I used the timeseries and ARIMA model to forecast the prices of Avocados and their volume through 2020.

I started out by comparing the month to month pricing of both conventional and organic avocados. The similarity on both sides is that, both label see a massive price drop during month of october til december.

Then, I have made tufts box plots here for both labels to plot average yearly prices comparing each states here in USA. We see that 2017 was bad year price wise for both labels in every state, because price whiskers (meaning more variation) were fairly large.

Here is the box plot comapring average prices state by state for organic label-

Furthermore, we can see the time series models for both volume and price for conventional label avocados-

Similarly, here are the time series models of pricing and volume for organic label avocados-

Method I have used to forecast is to add the time series of the current data, added to the ARIMA to predict the future prices and volume.

The results are as follows-

Overall, price and volume of conventional avocados will be somewhat stable, this could be due to bigger consumption of this label. Whereas, organic label avocados will have an erratic pricing and demands throughout 2020. However, intresting behaviour is that, lower limits on the volume of organic avocados is much more contained/closed together, than those limits of conventional avocados.

So, I think I can get away one more year without buying an Avocado Orchard!
