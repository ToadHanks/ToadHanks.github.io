In this project, I am forecasting the price of Hass Avocados in 2019-2020 using the time-series, and ARIMA. I have used the CSV file containing average price and the average volume of avocados, and regions where these avocados are sold.

Please feel free to look through the **source code** [here](https://github.com/ToadHanks/Story_de_Hass_Avocados_en_2020).

I love avocados however when I go out to eat, the rising price of guac leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So I looked around what kind of data set is around, luckily, there was one data set lying around that had records from 2015 till early 2018. Hence I asked myself, *"Should I buy an Avocado Orchard the way Oprah did?"* Therefore I used the time-series and ARIMA model to forecast the prices of Avocados and their volume through 2020.

I started by comparing the month to month pricing of both conventional and organic avocados. The similarity on both sides is that both labels see a massive price drop from October till December-

Then, I have made tufts box plots for both avocado labels to plot average yearly prices comparing each state in the USA. We see that 2017 was bad year price wise for both labels in every state because price whiskers (meaning more variation) were fairly large-

Here is the box plot comparing average prices state by state for the organic label-

Furthermore, we can see the time series models for both the volume and price of conventional label avocados-

Similarly, here are the time series models for pricing and volume of organic label avocados-

The method I have used to forecast is to add the time series of the current data, added to the ARIMA to predict the future prices and volume. The results are as follows-

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/avocados/forecast_org_price.png" alt="">

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/avocados/forecast_org_vol.png" alt="">

Overall, the price and volume of conventional avocados will be somewhat stable, this could be due to bigger consumption of this label. Whereas, organic label avocados will have erratic pricing and demands throughout 2020. However, interesting behaviour is that lower limits on the volume of organic avocados are much more closely together than those limits of conventional avocados.

So, I think I can get away one more year without buying an Avocado Orchard!
