In this project I am forecasting the price of Hass Avocados in 2020 using the time-series, and ARIMA. I have used the CSV file containing average price and average volume of avocados, and regions where these avocados are sold.

You can find the source code and data file [here](https://github.com/ToadHanks/storyOfHassAvocadoIn2020).

I love avocados however when I go out to eat, the rising price of guac leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So I looked around what kind of data set is around. Luckily, there was one data set lying around that had records from 2015 till early 2018. So I asked myself, "Should I buy an Avocado Orchard the way Oprah did?" so I used the timeseries and ARIMA model to forecast the prices of Avocados and their volume in 2020.

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's another image using Kramdown:

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$
